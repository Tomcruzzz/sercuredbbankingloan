<p class="auto-style1" align="left" >&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secure mining  was founded with one clear goal: to make your loan search simpler, easier, faster.
Secure mining products, especially the security TransUnion Score and the CIR(Credit Information Reports) are very important in the loan approval process. The credit score helps loan providers quickly determine, who they would like to evaluate further to provide credit. The security TransUnion Score ranges from 100 to 900. Our data indicates that loan providers prefer credit scores which are greater than 500.</p>
    <p class="auto-style1" align="left" >&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style1" align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the loan provider has decided which set of loan applicants to evaluate, it analyzes the CIR in order to determine the applicant's eligibility. Eligibility basically means the applicant's ability to take additional debt and repay additional outflows given their current commitments.
Post completion of these first 2 steps the loan provider will request for the applicant's income proof and other relevant documents in order to finally sanction the loan.
